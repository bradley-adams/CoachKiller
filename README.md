## CoachKiller
Currently a mix between a player profile app and a pick a team app. Started as my pesonal project at EDA and kept growing. Eventually used the fullstack we learnt. Continues to be something I enjoy tinkering with. Rugby has been a passion of mine for a couple of decades now.

### To do
  * Put on Heroku
  * Can't select 2 players.
  * Improve player cards/ action cards / weetbix cards
  * Create coach profile
  * Improve the results page. Compare with action cards.
  * Create player profiles. Player stats. 
  * Multiple tables working together rather then state stuff
  * Nav bar having maker.

### Stretch
  * Being able to match players against different games this year.
  * Being able to match players against for different years.

### Development Notes
  * Hard to style results page as you have to input the team everytime you reload.
